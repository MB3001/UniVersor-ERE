# UniVersor-ERE
UniVersor Experimental Root Edition. The first pre-1V implementation ever made and published. You can fork this or help its development.
You can move with 'ASDW' and shoot balls with left click. You close the program with "Esc" key.
It is built with JMonkeyEngine (http://jmonkeyengine.org/).
